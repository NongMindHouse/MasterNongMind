# 🔮 Fine Tuning Genetic Algorithm Parameters for Solving Mastermind (MasterNongMind)
> 👀 Creating a Mastermind puzzle guessing algorithm using permutations and handcrafted rule-based solutions.

### ℹ️ About this Project
- 📚 **Project Background:** "MasterNongMind" is "a one of many projects" we did for the course `CPE231 Algorithm` in the `Computer Engineering` at `⚙️🐜KMUTT`, where students apply algorithmic knowledge to solve the Mastermind puzzle.
- 🎯 **Project Goal:** The primary objective of "MasterNongMind" is to design and implement an efficient algorithm for solving the classic Mastermind puzzle.
- 💡 **Mastermind** is a game of logic and deduction where one player creates a secret code, and the other player, in this case, the algorithm, attempts to guess the code within a limited number of turns. The aim is to create a robust, rule-based solution that can effectively deduce the secret code by making logical guesses.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation:** Success will be measured by the number of turns needed to guess the code, guess accuracy, and algorithm efficiency.
- 📄 **References & Acknowledgement** Our work is based on the paper by Berghman, L., Goossens, D., & Leus, R. (2009), titled ["Efficient solutions for Mastermind using genetic algorithms"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2008.06.004) (Computers & Operations Research, 36(6), 1880-1885). This paper provided us with valuable insights into designing the genetic algorithm to work with Mastermind. Another honorable mention is the [mastermind-genetic-algorithm](https://github.com/blob42/mastermind-genetic-algorithm) repository, which provides guidelines for implementing the genetic algorithm in `Python`.
