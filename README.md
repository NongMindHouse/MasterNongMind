# 🔮 MasterNongMind
> 👀 Creating a Mastermind puzzle guessing algorithm using permutations and handcrafted rule-based solutions.

### ℹ️ About this Project
- 📚 **Project Background:** "MasterNongMind" is a project for `CPE231` `Algorithm course in the Computer Engineering` course at KMUTT, where students apply algorithmic knowledge to solve the Mastermind puzzle.
- 🎯 **Project Goal:** The primary objective of "MasterNongMind" is to design and implement an efficient algorithm for solving the classic Mastermind puzzle.
- 💡 **Mastermind** is a game of logic and deduction where one player creates a secret code, and the other player, in this case, the algorithm, attempts to guess the code within a limited number of turns. The aim is to create a robust, rule-based solution that can effectively deduce the secret code by making logical guesses.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation:** Success will be measured by the number of turns needed to guess the code, guess accuracy, and algorithm efficiency.

### ⚙️ Technical Concept 
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Implemented in `C programming`  
- 📦 Algorithm:
  - Permutations (Bruteforce/Heap) to generate every possible code combination.
  - Genetic Algorithms to enhance decision-making abilities based on all previous feedback.
